## What I do
---

### Data journalism
As a (freelance) data journalist I collect, analyze and communicate data using mostly Python üêç.
You can see my work at for example [OneWorld.nl](https://www.oneworld.nl/personen/adriana-homolova/) or [Pointer.nl](https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/artikelen/zeldzame-vogels-in-gevaar-door-stikstofvervuiling) (in Dutch)

### Data trainings
I have been training journalists in various Python skills at conferences around the world: [Dataharvest](dataharvest.eu/)(EU), [NICAR](https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/conferences/nicar-2019)(US), [SKUP](https://www.skup.no/)(NO)

### Data consultancy/ coordination for journalistic projects
Or data nerd in chief: I can help your project to reach it's data goals!
